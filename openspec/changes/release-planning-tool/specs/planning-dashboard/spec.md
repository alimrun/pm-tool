## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Timeline of all releases
The system SHALL present a dashboard that shows every release plan as a horizontal bar on a shared time axis, positioned by its start and end dates, so overlapping and sequential releases are visible at a glance. Each release bar SHALL display its project, name, owning team, and window, and SHALL render its four phases as distinct colored segments.

#### Scenario: Releases rendered on a time axis
- **WHEN** a user opens the dashboard
- **THEN** the system draws each release as a bar on a shared date axis with its phase segments and labels

#### Scenario: Empty state
- **WHEN** no releases match the current view
- **THEN** the system shows an empty-state message instead of a blank timeline

### Requirement: Group releases by team
The system SHALL be able to group the timeline by team so that all releases owned by a team appear on that team's row(s), making it easy to see when a team is continuously busy and when it is next free.

#### Scenario: Team grouping shows a team's continuous workload
- **WHEN** a user views the dashboard grouped by team
- **THEN** each team's releases appear together in chronological order on the time axis

### Requirement: Highlight team booking overlaps
The system SHALL visually flag on the dashboard any two releases owned by the same team whose windows overlap, so double-booked periods are obvious without opening each release.

#### Scenario: Overlap is visually flagged
- **WHEN** two releases owned by the same team overlap in time
- **THEN** the system highlights the overlapping bars (or the overlapping region) and shows a conflict indicator

#### Scenario: No overlap, no flag
- **WHEN** a team's releases do not overlap
- **THEN** the system shows them without any conflict indicator

### Requirement: Filter the timeline
The system SHALL allow filtering the dashboard by year, quarter, project, and team, and SHALL default to the current year. Filters SHALL be combinable.

#### Scenario: Filter by quarter and team
- **WHEN** a user selects a specific year, quarter, and team
- **THEN** the system shows only releases matching all selected filters

#### Scenario: Default view is the current year
- **WHEN** a user opens the dashboard without choosing filters
- **THEN** the system shows releases for the current year
